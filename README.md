- 👋 Hi, I’m @uASKfoIT
I am a student graduating in december 2024. I got interested in computer science by playing my first ever video game called Call of Duty Black Ops. It was amazing to know that someone or something was able to create a game
where it felt that you were in a different world.
I hope to achieve the same with my career. While I am still a noob in programming compared to the other amazing programmers.
My goal is that one day I will too create something that people will enjoy. When I mean by something that people will enjoy, I mean create something
that that people can enjoy and have fun =) just like I did. ("Not so much for the money - for the corporate heads"). Yes almost forgot, don't forget about Steve. 

- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and cultures.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development, and languages. 
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects
  
- 📫 How to reach me github
   
- 😄 Pronouns: none, does not bother me.
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to travel and learn about life, it's amazing to see how other people live.
