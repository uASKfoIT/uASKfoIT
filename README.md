- 👋 Hi, I’m @uASKfoIT
I am a 2024 grad. I got interested in computer science by playing my first ever video game called Call of Duty Black Ops. It was amazing to know that someone or something was able to create a game
where it felt that you were in a different world.
I hope to achieve the same with my career. While I am still a nooby in programming compared to the other amazing programmers.
My goal is that one day, I will too create something that people will enjoy. P.S don't forget about Steve. 

- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and cultures.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development, and languages. 
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects
